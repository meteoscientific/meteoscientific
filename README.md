- 👋 Hey-o, this is the MeteoScientific account.
- 👀 We like helping non-technical people use technology to improve their business.  Whether it's a trade like plumbing or roofing or you're running an AirBnB, our goal is to make complicated tech easier to understand and work with.  Our background is on the Helium LoRaWAN, but it's a big world with a lot to learn and we love all of it!
- 🌱 We're currently focusing on the MetSci Chirpstack LNS and the MetSci app.
- 💞️ We would be thrilled to find someone who can help us with improving and customizing our version of the Chirpstack UI.
- 📫 You can hit us on email using the meteoscientific.com domain and then git at, or...
- 🌎 ust hit the [metsci.ai/git](https://metsci.ai/gitvisitor) link which will take you to our home page and let me know folks are visiting from Github.
- 📖 We're called MeteoScientific because we love weather and science.  That's where this whole journey started for us, but it ain't where it's ending.  LFG!
